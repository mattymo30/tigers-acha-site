PROBLEM: Player stats are not separated by conference and non-conference games. It takes looking into two sites to separate the statistics.

SOLUTION: Create a new site for the Tigers ACHA Hockey Team that scrapes from the two sites, and consolidates the information together so the user can distinguish between the two either separately or combined.
